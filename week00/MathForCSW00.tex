%   \frametitle{Course Evaluation}
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item 50\% Weekly Exercises
%     \begin{itemize}
%     \item One to three questions will be posed in class;

%     \item Submission must be a PDF on MANABA;
%     \end{itemize}
%
%     \bigskip
%
%   \item 50\% Final Exam
%   \end{itemize}
%
%   \vfill
%
%   \begin{block}{Extra Credit}
%     I often give extra credit to students who participate in class
%     with questions, interesting comments, good suggestions, etc.
%   \end{block}
% \end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Course Evaluation}{\structure{Online Version}}

  The grade of this course will be the weighted average between the Weekly Exercises and the Final Exam.\bigskip

  \begin{itemize}
  \item 70\% Weekly Exercises
    \begin{itemize}
    \item One to three questions will be posed in class;
    \item You must answer your exercises individually;
    \item Submission must be a PDF on MANABA;
    \end{itemize}
    \bigskip

  \item 30\% Final Exam
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The final exam will cover topics from all lectures;
    \item The final exam will probably be \alert{Face to Face}; Let me know if you have problems.
  \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{About the Course Language}

  One of the goals of this lecture is to raise your level of technical
  English. However, this is not an English Class.

  \bigskip

  I expect the students to submit their exercises and exam answers in
  English. It does not need to be perfect, but I expect you to make a
  good effort.
