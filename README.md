These are the materials for the "Mathematics for Computer Sciences" undergraduate lectures at the University of Tsukuba (GB13604).

# Course Outline 

This course teaches fundamental mathematical concepts, focused on their application and usefulness for computer sciences. This course is based on the ["Mathematics for Computer Science"](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/) OpenCourseware from MIT.
