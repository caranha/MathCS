## Week 1: Basic Logic and Proofs
- For 2025: 
  - More examples for "Implies" rules
  - More examples for "Every" and "For All"

## Week 2:
- For 2024:
  - Move Relations and Sets to 3rd part
    (After Induction and State Machine)
  - Replace MIT Figures and examples with Tsukuba Ver.
  - Improve "Surjective" etc explanation (Examples)
  - Improve "Composite" explanation (Examples)

- For 2025:
  - Return part about using relations to measure set sizes
    (Lecture 1.11 in the material)
  - Maybe talk about Structural Induction.

## Week 3:
- Generally ok.

- TODO: Add 15 minutes explanation of the RSA:
  - More complete algorithm
  - Role of Euler function in the RSA
  - How to break RSA
  (proof of Euler function is a good exercise)

## Week 4:
- NOT OK.
  - Last half of lecture 4 needs a rewrite!
  - The last section, about Graph Assymetry and Relations is weird, not easy to explain, 
    with confusing slides. THIS PART NEEDS TO BE REWRITTEN!

## Week 5:

## Week 6--10: Check if Ye has changed the slides, add my own improvements.
## Week 6--7: Combinatorics
- Needs an explanation of Closed forms and recurrence
- Needs Plug and Chug and harmonics
- Put the "discrete" parts of 6 and 7 in one lecture, and re-add the recurrence lecture as another
  (6 recurrence, 7 discrete?)
	- Add the explanation of using limits to estimate upper and lower
	  bound to the harmonic numbers
	- Add Plug-and-Chug for proving Towers of Hanoi and Merge-sort
- Week 6, discrete:
	- Add Stirling's approximation of factorial for permutations

## Week 8: Probability and Conditional Probability
- There are some typos
- Weird dice needs to come before Probability spaces
