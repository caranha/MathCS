# 2021
## Week 1: Basic Logic and Proofs
- Improve the definition of SAT problem (maybe talk about DNF format)

## Week 2:
- Replace "binary relations" figures with my own
- Add talk about using "binary relations"
- Talk about Recursive data Type and Structural Induction
  - Example with string bracket parsing (chapter 1.10 on site?)
  - Structural Induction for functions: base case and constructors.
  - Fast Exponentiation
- Talk about Infinite Sets (1.11 on site)
  - Why is CS interested in infinite sets if computers are finite?
  - The sets we use are actuall infinite! (Natural, real, sets of sets)
  - countables sets, cantor's theorem, halting problem, etc.
- After composite relation:
  - Add a discussion about a relation T (teaching) and its relation with
    RV (for example, can we test whether T\intRV = nothing?)

## Week 3: Mod, Number Theory, algorithms
- There are MANY typos in the lecture -- fix them: specially differences between < and <=
- Improve RSA:
  - Add a number example of calculating plaintext and cryptotext
  - Explain how to calculate d
  - Add a last slide about how hard it is to break RSA.

## Week 4:
- Partial Orders:
  - There are multiple partial orders for one graph.
  - Improve the relationship between scheduling and parallel
    processing.

- Extras:
  - Animation of matrix multiplication for paths.
  - Show what happens on adjacency matrix multiplication
    with self loops, and without self loops.
    (How to see a total connection, how to find loops)

## Week 6--7: Combinatorics
- Needs an explanation of Closed forms and recurrence
- Needs Plug and Chug and harmonics
- Put the "discrete" parts of 6 and 7 in one lecture, and re-add the recurrence lecture as another
  (6 recurrence, 7 discrete?)
	- Add the explanation of using limits to estimate upper and lower
	  bound to the harmonic numbers
	- Add Plug-and-Chug for proving Towers of Hanoi and Merge-sort
- Week 6, discrete:
	- Add Stirling's approximation of factorial for permutations

## Week 8: Probability and Conditional Probability
- There are some typos
- Weird dice needs to come before Probability spaces
