Material improvement:

## Week 1: Basic Logic and Proofs
- Improve section 3, linking the "propositional cauculus" slides more and
  talking about SAT and its relationship with CS in more detail.
- Do note that this lecture is already rather long.

## Week 2:
- Generally ok.
- Replace the figures in these materials with my own figures
- TODO: Add a slide talking about how we can use relations to measure set sizes (lecture 1.11)
- TODO: Maybe talk about structural induction (lecture already too long, though)

## Week 3:
- Generally ok.
- TODO: Add explanation/proof of the calculation for encryption/decription of RSA.
- TODO: Add proof of Euler function?

## Week 4:
- It is probably worth it to re-read chapter 9 and re-order the topics of this chapter to make it easier to follow the requisites.



## Week 6--7: Combinatorics
- Needs an explanation of Closed forms and recurrence
- Needs Plug and Chug and harmonics
- Put the "discrete" parts of 6 and 7 in one lecture, and re-add the recurrence lecture as another
  (6 recurrence, 7 discrete?)
	- Add the explanation of using limits to estimate upper and lower
	  bound to the harmonic numbers
	- Add Plug-and-Chug for proving Towers of Hanoi and Merge-sort
- Week 6, discrete:
	- Add Stirling's approximation of factorial for permutations

## Week 8: Probability and Conditional Probability
- There are some typos
- Weird dice needs to come before Probability spaces
