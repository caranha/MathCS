## Week 1: Basic Logic and Proofs
- "Modus Ponens": Improve the explanation
  - IMPORTANT: First needs to explain "imply"/"if"
  - Explain the "divide" -> "means that" symbol.
  - First proof method: Modus ponens: P, P->Q, Q
- FIX: Replace the sqrt{3} proof with a simpler proof of
  modus ponens (all men are mortal, etc)
- SAT: Improve the explanation of Satisfiability
  - First, explain Propositions with variables. (use only binary variables)
  - Explain Valid and Satisfiable propositions, and how you can test it with Truth Tables (don't explain Truth tables).
  - Explain Every and Exists, and their relationship with Valid and Satisfiable.
  - More involved example of satisfiability: Show a set of Propositions (say, 3), and ask for a
    set of variable values that satisfy the propositions (similar to exercise 3)
  - Explain SAT problem in computer science.

## Week 2: Sets, Relations and Induction
- Error: Slide 26 -- Function Surjection and size: Change to Surjection
- Part 1: Explanation of set and surjection should be smaller. Need to
  imporve what is Surjection.
- Part 2: Induction. Slides are kinda ok, but explanation needs to be slower.
  The point that you need to assume P(n) correct was not clear.

## Week 3: Mod, Number Theory, algorithms
- There are MANY typos in the lecture -- fix them: specially differences between < and <=
- Improve RSA:
  - Add a number example of calculating plaintext and cryptotext
  - Explain how to calculate d
  - Add a last slide about how hard it is to break RSA.

## Week 4:
- Partial Orders:
  - There are multiple partial orders for one graph.
  - Improve the relationship between scheduling and parallel
    processing.

- Extras:
  - Animation of matrix multiplication for paths.
  - Show what happens on adjacency matrix multiplication
    with self loops, and without self loops.
    (How to see a total connection, how to find loops)

## Week 6--7: Combinatorics
- Needs an explanation of Closed forms and recurrence
- Needs Plug and Chug and harmonics
- Put the "discrete" parts of 6 and 7 in one lecture, and re-add the recurrence lecture as another 
  (6 recurrence, 7 discrete?)
	- Add the explanation of using limits to estimate upper and lower
	  bound to the harmonic numbers
	- Add Plug-and-Chug for proving Towers of Hanoi and Merge-sort
- Week 6, discrete:
	- Add Stirling's approximation of factorial for permutations

## Week 8: Probability and Conditional Probability
- There are some typos
- Weird dice needs to come before Probability spaces
