## Week 1: Basic Logic and Proofs
- Improved for 2024

## Week 2:
- TODO: Need to improve part about relations
  - Replace MIT figures and examples with Tsukuba versions
  - Improve the explanation about composite relationship

- FUTURE: Add a slide talking about how we can use relations 
  to measure set sizes (lecture 1.11)
- FUTURE: Maybe talk about structural induction 
  (lecture already too long, though)

## Week 3:
- Generally ok.

- TODO: Add 15 minutes explanation of the RSA:
  - More complete algorithm
  - Role of Euler function in the RSA
  - How to break RSA
  (proof of Euler function is a good exercise)

## Week 4:
- NOT OK.
  - Last half of lecture 4 needs a rewrite!
  - The last section, about Graph Assymetry and Relations is weird, not easy to explain, 
    with confusing slides. THIS PART NEEDS TO BE REWRITTEN!

## Week 5:

## Week 6--10: Check if Ye has changed the slides, add my own improvements.
## Week 6--7: Combinatorics
- Needs an explanation of Closed forms and recurrence
- Needs Plug and Chug and harmonics
- Put the "discrete" parts of 6 and 7 in one lecture, and re-add the recurrence lecture as another
  (6 recurrence, 7 discrete?)
	- Add the explanation of using limits to estimate upper and lower
	  bound to the harmonic numbers
	- Add Plug-and-Chug for proving Towers of Hanoi and Merge-sort
- Week 6, discrete:
	- Add Stirling's approximation of factorial for permutations

## Week 8: Probability and Conditional Probability
- There are some typos
- Weird dice needs to come before Probability spaces
