Material improvement:
# FOR 2023: 
- Last half of lecture 4 needs a rewrite!
- Fix typos (a few here and there)
- Improve Relations on lecture 2
- Improve RSA on lecture 3

## Week 1: Basic Logic and Proofs
- TYPO in the logical formulas (can't remember where)

- Improve section 3, linking the "propositional cauculus" slides more and
  talking about SAT and its relationship with CS in more detail.
- Do note that this lecture is already rather long.


## Week 2:
- TYPO: Strong induction game example has a formula error

- TODO: Need to fix part about relations
  - Replace MIT figures and examples with Tsukuba versions
  - Improve the explanation about composite relationship

- FUTURE: Add a slide talking about how we can use relations to measure set sizes (lecture 1.11)
- FUTURE: Maybe talk about structural induction (lecture already too long, though)

## Week 3:
- Generally ok.

- TODO: Add explanation relating the Euler function with the RSA (related to the TODO below)
- TODO: Add explanation/proof of the calculation for encryption/decription of RSA.
- TODO: Add proof of Euler function?

## Week 4:
- NOT OK.
  - The last section, about Graph Assymetry and Relations is weird, not easy to explain, 
    with confusing slides. THIS PART NEEDS TO BE REWRITTEN!



## Week 6--7: Combinatorics
- Needs an explanation of Closed forms and recurrence
- Needs Plug and Chug and harmonics
- Put the "discrete" parts of 6 and 7 in one lecture, and re-add the recurrence lecture as another
  (6 recurrence, 7 discrete?)
	- Add the explanation of using limits to estimate upper and lower
	  bound to the harmonic numbers
	- Add Plug-and-Chug for proving Towers of Hanoi and Merge-sort
- Week 6, discrete:
	- Add Stirling's approximation of factorial for permutations

## Week 8: Probability and Conditional Probability
- There are some typos
- Weird dice needs to come before Probability spaces
