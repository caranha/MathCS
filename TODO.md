## Week 1: Basic Logic and Proofs
- TODO: improve definition of SAT problem, specially the relationship
  between SAT and computer science.
- TODO: talk about DNF format? See material in the book.

## Week 2:
- Generally ok.
- Need to replace the figures in this class with my own
- TODO: talk about measuring set sizes with relations, and infinite sets
  (lecture 1.11 on the site)
- TODO: talk about structural induction? Maybe lecture too long?

## Week 3: Mod, Number Theory, algorithms
- There are MANY typos in the lecture -- fix them: specially differences between < and <=
- Improve RSA:
  - Add a number example of calculating plaintext and cryptotext
  - Explain how to calculate d
  - Add a last slide about how hard it is to break RSA.

## Week 4:
- Partial Orders:
  - There are multiple partial orders for one graph.
  - Improve the relationship between scheduling and parallel
    processing.

- Extras:
  - Animation of matrix multiplication for paths.
  - Show what happens on adjacency matrix multiplication
    with self loops, and without self loops.
    (How to see a total connection, how to find loops)

## Week 6--7: Combinatorics
- Needs an explanation of Closed forms and recurrence
- Needs Plug and Chug and harmonics
- Put the "discrete" parts of 6 and 7 in one lecture, and re-add the recurrence lecture as another
  (6 recurrence, 7 discrete?)
	- Add the explanation of using limits to estimate upper and lower
	  bound to the harmonic numbers
	- Add Plug-and-Chug for proving Towers of Hanoi and Merge-sort
- Week 6, discrete:
	- Add Stirling's approximation of factorial for permutations

## Week 8: Probability and Conditional Probability
- There are some typos
- Weird dice needs to come before Probability spaces
