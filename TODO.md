## Week 1: Basic Logic and Proofs
- For 2025: 
  - More examples for "Implies" rules
  - More examples for "Every" and "For All"

## Week 2:
- For 2025:
    - Relations: Replace MIT figures and examples with DrawIO figures
    - Improve explanation of Types of binary relations (surj, inj, etc)
      - Increase the number of slides (one for in, one for out)
      - Give more and easier examples
      - Explain why this is useful (Mention that chapter 7 shows these definitions being used to compare the size of infinite sets)
  - More in the future (2026+):
    - Induction: Actually introduce the repeated exponation algorithm state machine here.
    - Relations: Actually show example of using relations to compare sizes of infinity (ch7)

## Week 3:
- Generally ok.

- TODO: Add 15 minutes explanation of the RSA:
  - More complete algorithm
  - Role of Euler function in the RSA
  - How to break RSA
  (proof of Euler function is a good exercise)

## Week 4:
- TODO: Fixed the "Graphs, Partial Orders, Relations" part in 2024.
- TODO: Add some stuff about detecting isomorphism in 2025. 
- IDEA: Add some easy exercises to the book to the final slide to use the remaining time?


## Week 5:

## Week 6--10: Check if Ye has changed the slides, add my own improvements.
## Week 6--7: Combinatorics
- Needs an explanation of Closed forms and recurrence
- Needs Plug and Chug and harmonics
- Put the "discrete" parts of 6 and 7 in one lecture, and re-add the recurrence lecture as another
  (6 recurrence, 7 discrete?)
	- Add the explanation of using limits to estimate upper and lower
	  bound to the harmonic numbers
	- Add Plug-and-Chug for proving Towers of Hanoi and Merge-sort
- Week 6, discrete:
	- Add Stirling's approximation of factorial for permutations

## Week 8: Probability and Conditional Probability
- There are some typos
- Weird dice needs to come before Probability spaces
