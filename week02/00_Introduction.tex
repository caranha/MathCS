\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}[t]{Lecture 2 -- Outline}
  In the first lecture, we covered the basic concepts of proofs. In this lecture, we first introduce a very important proof method, {\bf Induction}.\medskip
  
  After that, we discuss the concepts of {\bf state machines} and {\bf sets}.\bigskip
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf Section 1:} Proof by Induction -- Chapter 5
    \item {\bf Section 2:} State Machines -- Chapter 5
    \item {\bf Section 3:} Sets and Relations -- Chapter 4
  \end{itemize}\bigskip

  I highly recommend that you also study chapters 6 and 7 to learn more advanced topics related to Induction and Sets.
